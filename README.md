# Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo-with-an-LSTM-Network
In this notebook, we will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. We will even be able to listen to our own music at the end of the project.

We will learn to:

1.)Apply an LSTM to music generation.

2.)Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.
